Feature: Browse health statuses
  In order to browse health statuses
  As the system user
  I should be able to send api requests related to health statuses

#  @createSchema @loadFixtures @dropSchema
#  Scenario: Browse all health statuses
#    When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
#    And I send a "GET" request to "/system/health"
#    Then the response status code should be 200
#    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json"
#    And the response should be in JSON
